# Terra-Create ZSs

Since Terra Firma Craft: The Next Generation(TFC:TNG) has released its open beta version for Minecraft 1.18.2, it is the very time to merge the experience of TFC:TNG and Create, two of my favorite mods.The purpose of this project is to make TFC:TNG and Create mod Compatible by modifying the crafting recipe in Minecraft 1.18.2.

## How to use?

1. Make sure that you already installed the forge version of TFC:TNG, Create, CraftTweaker, CreateTweaker and all their dependencies in Minecraft 1.18.2.
2. Run the game for once if you haven't do so.
3. Drag all the .zs file in the project to your .minecraft/scripts folder.
4. Enjoy!

## Roadmap
1. Use TFC items and methods to make Create items.
2. Use Create methods to produce TFC items.
